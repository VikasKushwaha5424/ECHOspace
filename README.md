## 📦 About The Project

ECHOspace is a modern, web-based chat application inspired by leading messaging platforms.  
Users can register, log in, search for others, and chat privately in real time with both text and images.  
The dynamic frontend is built with React.js. Backend is powered by Firebase using Authentication, Firestore, and Storage.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using email and password.
- 💬 **Real-time Chat**: Instant messaging powered by Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener.
- 🖼️ **Image Uploads**: Send images in chats, directly uploaded to Firebase Storage.
- 🔍 **User Search**: Quickly find any registered user and start a conversation.
- 🌓 **Light/Dark Mode**: Theme toggle respects user preference and persists in `localStorage`.
- 🎨 **Custom Backgrounds**: Personalize your chat window; settings saved to Firestore user profile.
- 👤 **Avatars & Initials**: User-uploaded avatars, with color-generated initial fallback.
- 🗑️ **Delete Chats**: Remove unwanted chats from your personal list.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layout built with SASS/SCSS.
- ⚛️ **Modern React**: Fully functional components, hooks, and Context API for global state.
